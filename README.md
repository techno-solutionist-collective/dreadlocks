`dreadlocks`
==

> :lock: A cross-platform file-locking software library for Python that
> supports thread-level locks, process-level locks, and both simultaneously.


## API Documentation

See [docs](https://proc-2.github.io/dreadlocks/latest).


## Development

The only external requirements are Python and `poetry`.

`poetry` takes care of setting up a minimal environment with `tox` and `pre-commit` installed.
For that run:

```sh
poetry install --only dev
```

All other environments are managed by `tox` (and uses `poetry` internally).


### Lint

```sh
poetry run tox -e lint-check
```

> :information_source: Some linting errors can be automatically fixed with
> `poetry run tox -e lint`.


###  Type check

```sh
poetry run tox -e type-check
```


### Tests

> :information_source: Add the `-cover` suffix to generate coverage
> information.

#### Unit tests

```sh
poetry run tox -e unit
```

#### Doctests

```sh
poetry run tox -e doctest
```


#### Coverage

If tests have been run with the `-cover` suffix, coverage reports can be
generated with `poetry run tox -e coverage`.

The HTML coverage report can be served to port `8000` with `poetry run tox -e
coverage-serve`.


### Dependencies licenses

Dependencies licenses can be checked with `poetry run tox -e licenses`.
